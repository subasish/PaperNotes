# Data-Driven Intelligent Transportation Systems: A Survey

----------
# Key Points


- There are six fundamental components in ITS as follows: 
  1. advanced transportation management systems;
  2. advanced traveler information systems;
  3. advanced vehicle control systems;
  4. business vehicle management;
  5. advanced public transportation systems;
  6. advanced urban transportation systems.

- The result shows the following three observations: 
  1. Vision- and learning-driven ITS have received much attention from researchers in the ITS community; 
  2. although the number of papers related to learning issues is 23, only four of these papers are closely related to the development of ITS, leaving more room for further research for directly addressing issues in D2ITS; 
  3. several directions, e.g., multimodal evaluation criteria, visual analytics, and microblogs, have yet to received enough attention from ITS researchers.
